# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Developer Self-Service Portal - DSSP is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for developers to interact with GitHub Actions. It enhances the GitHub Actions experience by offering more intuitive forms, contextual information, and guided instructions. The portal acts on behalf of developer by using their GitHub tokens to make API calls, streamlining their workflow and reducing the complexity of working directly with GitHub Actions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GitHub Token Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure my GitHub token in the portal, so that it can perform actions on my behalf.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the portal for the first time THEN the system SHALL prompt for a GitHub personal access token.
2. WHEN a user provides a GitHub token THEN the system SHALL store it in the local configuration on the user's computer.
3. WHEN a stored token exists THEN the system SHALL automatically use it for GitHub API calls.
4. WHEN a token becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL notify the user and prompt for a new token.
5. WHEN a user chooses to reset their configuration THEN the system SHALL remove the stored token.
6. WHEN handling the GitHub token THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices for local configuration storage.

### Requirement 2: Curated GitHub Actions List

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a curated list of GitHub Actions, so that I can select which one to run.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the portal THEN the system SHALL display a curated list of GitHub Actions.
2. WHEN displaying GitHub Actions THEN the system SHALL show relevant metadata (name, description, purpose, etc.).
3. WHEN new GitHub Actions are added to the curated list THEN the system SHALL make them available to users.
4. WHEN a GitHub Action is deprecated or removed THEN the system SHALL update the curated list accordingly.
5. WHEN the curated list grows THEN the system SHALL provide search and filtering capabilities.
6. WHEN adding actions to the catalog THEN the system SHALL support manual curation and enhancement of actions.
7. WHEN parsing GitHub workflow YAML THEN the system SHALL extract input structure and metadata.

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Workflow Execution Forms

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved forms for triggering GitHub Actions workflows, so that I can more easily provide the correct inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a workflow THEN the system SHALL display an enhanced form for workflow inputs.
2. WHEN displaying input fields THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help and validation.
3. WHEN an input has constraints THEN the system SHALL validate user input against these constraints.
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages.
5. WHEN a workflow has default values THEN the system SHALL pre-populate form fields with these values.
6. WHEN a workflow has complex input requirements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate UI controls (dropdowns, date pickers, etc.).
7. WHEN a workflow requires branch selection THEN the system SHALL provide an enhanced branch selector component.
8. WHEN using the branch selector THEN the system SHALL fetch and display recent branches from the repository.
9. WHEN displaying branches THEN the system SHALL show additional metadata such as last commit date and author.

### Requirement 4: Workflow Execution and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to trigger workflows and monitor their execution, so that I can ensure my tasks complete successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a workflow form THEN the system SHALL trigger the corresponding GitHub Action.
2. WHEN a workflow is triggered THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message.
3. WHEN a workflow is running THEN the system SHALL show real-time status updates.
4. WHEN a workflow completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user of the outcome.
5. WHEN a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information.
6. WHEN multiple workflows are running THEN the system SHALL allow monitoring all of them simultaneously.

### Requirement 5: Contextual Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated documentation and guidance, so that I understand how to use each workflow effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a workflow THEN the system SHALL show relevant documentation.
2. WHEN documentation exists in the repository THEN the system SHALL parse and display it alongside the workflow.
3. WHEN a workflow input has specific requirements THEN the system SHALL display this information next to the input field.
4. WHEN common errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance.
5. WHEN organization-specific guidelines exist THEN the system SHALL incorporate them into the documentation.

### Requirement 6: Workflow History and Results

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see my workflow execution history and results, so that I can track my activities and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the portal THEN the system SHALL display recent workflow executions.
2. WHEN a user selects a past execution THEN the system SHALL show detailed results and logs.
3. WHEN workflow artifacts are generated THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to download them.
4. WHEN filtering by status or date THEN the system SHALL update the history view accordingly.
5. WHEN a workflow produced errors THEN the system SHALL highlight these in the execution details.

### Requirement 7: Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the portal on different devices, so that I can manage workflows regardless of my current setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the portal on a desktop THEN the system SHALL display a full-featured interface.
2. WHEN accessing the portal on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for smaller screens.
3. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate layout adjustments.
4. WHEN using the portal on different browsers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality.

### Requirement 8: Security and Permissions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the portal to respect GitHub's permission model, so that I only see and execute workflows I have access to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying repositories and workflows THEN the system SHALL only show those the user has permission to access.
2. WHEN a user attempts to execute a workflow THEN the system SHALL verify they have the required permissions.
3. WHEN permissions change in GitHub THEN the system SHALL reflect these changes upon the next action.
4. WHEN storing any user data THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices.
5. WHEN handling GitHub tokens THEN the system SHALL use them only for authorized operations.
